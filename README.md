# travis_dayPlanner

Here's a dayplanner for your workday.
Time periods are broken into 1 hour blocks, which change color based on future, present, or past.
It has save buttons that save your inputs to your local drive so that you can close the page, and save your information.
It also has an updated clock that tells you the current day.
